# Instabug iOS Internship Program :smile:
I fixed all The Bugs in Swift playground , instabug first iOS challenge

The first step of Instabugâ€™s selection process is a coding task. I Just followed the instructions blew.

1. Clone this repo.
2. This repo contains a Swift playground. Open it and implement all the methods that are marked with **"To be implemented"**.
3. The playground implements an `Application` and a `Bug` class. The goal of the task is to be able to create some `Bug` objects, add them to an `Application`, then use `findBugs(state:timeRange:)` to filter those bugs.
4. The playground includes unit tests that run automatically and test that your code works as expected. *Only* submit your code if all tests pass.
5. When you've completed the task, add it to a GitHub repo and send us the URL.

While the playground includes tests that checks whether the implemented methods work as expected or not, your code will still be reviewed by humans. We love simple, elegant solutions that leverage Swift's powerful features.
